            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EARE Catholique Brethren who by Gods order and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition are to gayne your livelyhood by honeſt labour and induſtry; to you principally is this short method of devotion addreſſed: for although they whome the Divine Providence has placed in a heigher condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this world, are more plentifully furmisht with bookes and other helpes for their inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; yet the goodeneſſe of God
<pb facs="tcp:50595:3"/>is ſo great, as to accept your faithfull endevors according, to your capacity; and ſo as you love and ſerve him Religiouſly in your ſeverall vocations here upon earth, your reward will be equall with theirs in Heaven. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at are the prerogatives of the poore: who was poorer then La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus, who lay at the gate of the rich Glutton full of ſores and ulcers, ſuffering hungar, cold, and all kind of neceſſity? Yet his patience and conformity to the Divine will in thoſe his afflictions, obtaynd him the glory to be canoniz'd by Ieſus-Chriſt himſelfe, while the ſame preſumptuous rich Man, clad in purple garments, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his abundant wealth, and temporall felicity, was caſt downe into thoſe horrid flames,
<pb facs="tcp:50595:3"/>where he shall never ceaſe to be tormented.</p>
            <p>Whoever will enter in at Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven gate muſt ſtoope very low: the greateſt Princes if they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Eternall riches, muſt become like you, poore upon Earth, at leaſt in affection: Bleſſed are the poore of ſpirit, for theirs is the kingdome of Heaven: Yea the richeſt Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Carry no more with them out of the world then the pooreſt begger. When S. Iohn Baptiſt ſent his Diſciples to our Bleſſed Lord to informe themſelves, whither he were the Meſſias, or no; one of the markes he gave them wherby to proove himſelfe to be truly ſoe, was, that the poore receiu'd the Ghoſpell, which shewed that his Divine goodneſſe had the poore in recommendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:50595:4"/>
            <p> Since then by theſe paſſages and many more which are found amongſt the ſacred oracles of our Divine Maiſter; Yea ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce by his owne life and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we are taught how gratefull the poore are to him, and with what difficulty the rich enter into the kingdome of Heaven; you who are poore ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort your ſelves in your poverty, and reſt aſſured, that if God had foreſeene that riches would have more conduc'd to your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, he would have given you abundance, ſince it was as eaſy to his infinit power to have made you the richeſt Princes, as the pooreſt artiſans. Bleſſe then Gods goodneſſe in your poverty, love him fervently, ſerve him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; beleeve that his deſigne in makeing you poore, was to
<pb facs="tcp:50595:4"/>render your ſalvation more eaſy, ſince thoſe who have great poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, like the young man in the Goſpell forſake them with as great anxiety. Farewel and in your prayers remember.</p>

               <head>Reflections upon the dreadfull word of Aeternity.</head>
               <p>ONe good conſideration of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity makes all temporal fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity but contemptible [ſaith S. Greg.] yea that very thought of Aeternity gives courage to beare patiently all perſecution, and the afflictions of this miſerable life, and with S. Auguſtin it will make us ſay: here cutt, here burne, here doe not ſpare me Lord, ſo that thou ſpare me eternally. A ſerious reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Aeternity is a ſouverain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne remedy againſt all ſin: for who would preſume to offend God if he wel conſidered that by his ſin he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits an Aeternity of all beatitude; and engageth himſelfe to the endleſſe torments of Hel.</p>
               <p>A good reflection upon Aeternity is capable to make us to admire, to adore, and love Gods mercy, as alſo to dread his juſtice, in rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50595:44"/>ſo little ſervice done him in this world with everlaſting recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in the other: and for one mortal ſin, committed by thought or deed, to punish eternally in hell. O that this wholſome thought of Aeternity could take ſo deepe a roote in our ſoules, as never to be plucked from our thought. For what is Aeternity, but the meaſure of a preſent and perpetuall during with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. Imagin a thouſand millions of yeares; yea as many milions of yeares, as there have been moments from the beginning of the world, and shal be till the end therof: and then you may truly ſay how all that is nothing in comparaiſon of Aetetnity, which is to dure ſo long as God is God; and ſo long shall the juſt be bleſt with glory in Paraidſe; and the wicked remayne no leſſe in the tormenting flames of hell alwayes, for ever, and for Aeternity; and this for their foolish choyce, here to enjoy but one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50595:45"/>moment of vaine and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding pleaſure.</p>
               <p>O Aeternity, Aeternity, how is it poſſible that thou shouldſt be no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re conſidered by men! he doubtleſſe needs muſt want both faith and all true judgment who doth not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the ſerious true reflection upon Aeternity. Whereupon to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke good profit by this wholſome thought of Aeternity; conſider by an act of faith this certaine truth; that you are to be either happy or moſt miſerable for all Eternity; and that the laſt moment of your life is to determine this great affaire: and therefore when you finde your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe ſolicited to any ſin, deteſt that motion which for a moment of falſe content doth intice you moſt tray terouſly unto endleſſe miſery.</p>
               <p>Which to avoyde reſolve with a courageous reſolution to ſuffer both perſecution and all affliction whatſoever, much rather then to hazard the torments of Hell for all
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50595:45"/>Eternity. Fly ſin with great horrour, much more then death it ſelfe; and from the occaſions thereof, as the moſt dangerous ſerpent; it being only which can deſtroy you eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. In ſine he muſt either want faith, or be a foole who is not toucht nor drawes profit by this wholſome thought of Eternity: for can we jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge him leſſe then frantick, and quite out of his witts, who will venture by committing one mortall ſin to expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe himſelfe to damnation for all Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
               <p>Here followeth a briefe ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prieſtly ornaments at Maſſe; as alſo a short declaration of the other Ceremonies, and holy myſteries of that divine ſacrifice, for the inſtruction and comfort of the poore, and leſſe learned people, for whom this little manuel is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally intended; though not unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, I hope, to any, behoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo cleerly thereby how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50595:46"/>the bitter death and Paſſion of our divne Redeemer is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to our memory; wherby to ſtirr us up to love and gratitude for what ſo loving a Saviour hath ſuffered to pay our debt. And by this meanes to moove us alſo, for his ſake, and for the expiation of our grievous ſins, to ſuffer the afflictions which his bleſſed order and heavenly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath mercifully diſpoſed for us to undergoe in this world, therby to avoyde the eternall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the other.</p>
               <p>And now as for theſe ceremonies, ordayned for the more ſolemne cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the holy ſacrifice of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe; whereby the peoples devotion is much encreaced, God is more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifi'd, and our ſoules are inſtructed and drawne unto his love; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great impiety it is, proceeding chieffy from ignorance, in ſuch as doe ſo irreligiouſly diſpiſe thoſe holy Ceremonies, inſpired by the holy Ghoſt into his beloved ſpouſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50595:46"/>the Catholik Church, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creace of devotion, and greater Majeſty in Gods divine ſervice and worship.</p>
               <p>Yet here it is to be obſerved, that we doe not place any true perfection in theſe holy Ceremonies, but only uſe them as meanes wherby we are induced to true perfection of the love of God: à Ceremonie being only an outward religious act, no further piouſly laudable, then it is exercis'd for Gods honour and glory by its pious ſignification. And like as we know that chaſtity and poverty are not true perfection themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may, and alſo often tymes doe happen to be without it: yet none can deny them to be good meanes to obtayne contempt of the world, and the love of God, wherein only true perfection doth conſiſt. And as the children of Iſrael by behoulding the ſtones which their Fathers had brought with them when they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed dryfoot over the red ſea, were
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50595:47"/>put in mind of Gods great miracles in their protection, and were alſo mooved by that meanes greatly to love and honour God for it: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe holy Ceremonies put us in mind of their pious ſignifications; and are like ſavoury ſauce, which giveth a pleaſing relish to the meate, although of it ſelfe it be but of little ſubſtance. Or as the leaves, and barke, which although they beare no fruit, yet are both ornaments, and a needfull defence to preſerve the pleaſing fruit. The poles in the vineyard, beare no grapes, yet they ſuſtayne and preſerve the ſame. So likewiſe, although the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Church be neither the ſubſtance, nor the perfection of Religion, yet they preſerve, and doe alſo begett, and ſtirr up in us the reverance and gratefull memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the holy myſteries of our faith, and are an excellent, and needfull ornament to religion. Yea S. Aug. againſt Fauſtus the Manichean here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. li. 19. ſaith that: without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50595:47"/>Ceremonies it is impoſſible to preſerve Religion.</p>
               <p>This ſuppoſed, and [as I hope] you will find truly verifi'd by what doth follow: that now which in the next place I am to recommend to you, is that you having payed due honour and homage to God by your morning prayer; then apply your ſelfe to ſuch employments as the obligation of your preſent calling and condition may require of you. But if afterward good leaſure and oportunity be permitted you to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the divine ſacrifice of the Maſſe, omitt not to be preſent at that ſupreame act of our Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; wherby we give to God the higheſt honour of ſacrifice, which is proper to him alone: there being offered to him that moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull Hoſt of the law of grace, which is the ſacred body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt, that moſt pure and immaculate lambe of God, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch though but once only offered
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50595:48"/>in a viſible and bloody manner for us upon the Croſſe, as a ſacrifice of Redemption for all the ſins of the world; yet that very ſelf ſame ſacred Hoſt and victime, now daily is offered upon the holy Altar by the hands of the Prieſt in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody and inviſible forme; not as a new price or payment for our ſins; that being here only applyed in the Maſſe, which was already payed upon the Croſſe. Like as it is alſo applyd unto our ſoules, both by faith, by Baptiſme, and the other Sacraments: and therefore is here in the Maſſe but only as the reall true ſacrifice of application of the very ſelfſame victime, not in a bloody and viſible, manner, but in an unbloody and inviſible, under the ſacramentall formes of bread and wyne.</p>
               <p>And how avayleable now it is to all who devoutly aſſiſt at this holy ſacrifice, much and vith great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority might here be ſaid; but my
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50595:48"/>deſigne ayming at brevity, take on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what that divinely devout Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas a Kempis tells us in his imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt chap. 7. lib. 4. <hi>There is no oblation more worthy</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>no ſatisfaction greater for the washing away of ſin, then to offer up our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to God purely with the oblation of the body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt in the Maſſe, and holy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that this holy ſacrifice of the Maſſe is a moſt true and lively repreſentation of the life and death of Jeſus Chriſt; he who shall obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve either the ornaments of the Prieſt, or the ceremonies, and holy myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the Maſſe; will be forced to confeſſe that to be moſt true; as it will manifeſtly appeare to any who reade but our Catholick Authors, that explicate the primitive inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame.</p>

               <p>Having briefly here ſpoke of the quality, and colours of the chiefe ornaments belonging to the Altar.

               <p>And therefore thoſe ornaments if not very rich, at leaſt they ought to be comely and very decent, as well in regard of that great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which is moſt due to thoſe ſacred myſteries; as alſo that thoſe divine actions should be had in greater veneration; and therby the better to repreſent to us Chriſts bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death and paſſion; as I shall here declare by the meaning of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſeverall ornaments. Obſerving here firſt the great antiquity and uſe of thoſe holy ornaments; which well appeares in England by that of S.

               <p>In putting it on he ſaith; put on o Lord the helmit of ſalvation upon my head; that I may overcome all
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50595:54"/>my temptations to wicked ſin.</p>
               <p>The Albe, or long white garment,<note place="margin">of the Albe</note> doth ſignify the robe of innocency given us in the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. And it repreſents the white garment which Herod put upon our Saviour, reputing him as an ideot, when with mockery and deriſion he ſent him backe to Pilate.</p>
               <p>The Prieſt putting it on, he ſaith:<note place="margin">Luke 23</note> Make me white o Lord, and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſe my hart: that being whitned in the blood of the lambe, I may enjoy eternall gladneſſe.</p>
               <p>The girdle which the Prieſt puts about him,<note place="margin">of the Girdle</note> doth ſignify the corde wherewith our Saviour was bound to the pillar, when the cruell ſouldiers ſcourged him. The two ends of the girdle turned up: the one on the right ſide, and the other on the left, doe ſignify the two meanes to conſerve our chaſtity: which are faſting and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wherby we ſubdue the flesh and ſtrengthen the ſpirit. The Prieſt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50595:55"/>when he puteth the girdle about him, ſaith: gird me o Lord, with the girdle of purity, and quench in my loynes the humour of luſt, that there may remayne in me the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of continency and Chaſtity.</p>
               <p>The Manuple repreſents to us the cordes which bound our Saviour's hands and armes when he was drag'd from place to place,<note place="margin">of the Manuple</note> and from one Judge to an other. It is put on the left arme (which is neareſt to the hart) to declare with what love and affection he endured all thoſe outrageous injuries to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate our ſin.</p>
               <p>When the Prieſt putteth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuple upon his arme, he ſaith: vouchſafe me Lord ſo to beare the Manuple of weeping and ſorrow, that I may receive the reward of my labour with exultation. Which prayer alſo alludes to the antient devouter tymes, which uſed this manuple as a linning cloath or hand kercher to wype their teares which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50595:55"/>their fervent piety made often to runn in abundance from their eyes.<note place="margin">of the Stole</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Stole, which the Prieſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth about his neck; doth ſignify the yoke of obedience, even unto death upon the Croſſe: wherunto our Lord Jeſus ſubmitted himſelfe for our redemption. The Prieſt kiſſeth the Croſſe which is upon the middle of it, when he puteth it on; to shew his cheerefull will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſſe to beare the sweet yoke of Chriſt's Croſſe, with all patience in tribulation. He puteth the two ends of it overthwart his breaſt in forme of a Croſſe: repreſenting [ſaith S. Bonaventure] the paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt which the Prieſt ought to have moſt ſeriouſly fixed in his hart.</p>
               <p>The Stole alſo doth properly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify that long rope about our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's neck wherby thoſe barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous executioners dragged him char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the heavy croſſe upon his neck and bloody shoulders. The
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50595:56"/>two croſſes at the ends of the Stole hanging on either ſide of the Prieſt, doe ſignify the croſſes whereon the two theeves were crucifi'd by him, one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and the croſſe on the middle repreſents that wheron himſelfe was crucifid in the middle betwixt them both.</p>
               <p>The Prieſt in putting on the ſtole ſaith: Render me, o Lord, the ſtole of immortality, which I have loſt by the prevarication of my firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, in tranſgreſſing thy holy law.</p>
               <p>The Veſtment,<note place="margin">of the veſtment</note> repreſents that purple garment wherwith the Jewes did cloath our Lord and Saviour, after that his moſt tender body was all in gory blood with thoſe cruel ſtripes: and in ſcornfull mockery expoſed him to the peoples view with a reede in his hand, and a crowne of thornes on his head, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Ecce homo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Veſtment conſiſts of two

Finally the Prieſt when he puts on the veſtment ſaith. Lord thou who aſſureſt us that thy yoake is ſweet, and thy burthen light: vouchſafe that I may ſo weare this, as therby I may obtayne thy holy grace, Amen.</p>

               <p>The Clark carrieth the booke to the right end of the Altar,<note place="margin">Vvherfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the miſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaſ is layd firſt on the right ſide of the Altar. a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dvvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shutt</note> where he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it downe shutt to be opned after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Prieſt himſelfe.

And ſo ought the Prieſt to preach, to teach and to lay open the word of God and the holy ſcripture to the people; as his laying there open the booke doth ſignify.</p>
               <p>The prieſt in this ſort adorned, and accompanied with the Clark to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50595:58"/>aſſiſt him: and having placed the chalice upon the Altar, and opened the booke, he deſcends to the loweſt ſtepp. Where in imitation of the humble Publican, he profoundly boweth himſelfe to the Crucifix, ſaying (at leaſt in his hart] God be mercifull to me a ſinner. And then with all fervent devotion and true reverence he beginneth the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrifice of the Maſſe; in which Jeſus Chriſt, true God and Man, is really received; the memory of his death and paſſion is renewed; his ſacred merits are therby applyed in remiſſion of our ſins, our ſoules are replenished with many heavenly benedictions; and therin is given unto us the happy pledge of future and eternall glory.</p>
               <p>And the faithfull Chriſtian aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting devoutly at this holy ſacrifice, doth offer together with the Prieſt the ſelf ſame victime in expiation for his ſin, which was offered upon the croſſe for the Redemption of

               <p>AN injury patiently ſuffered for Jeſus Chriſt is much to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd before an act of great auſterity which may be omitted without ſin; but to fall into impatience, you cannot without offending God;

               <p>GOd hath no need of his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures for the execution of his deſigne; and therfore we ought not to be troubled at our owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency; he can doe what he pleaſeth without our help: and if it be for him that thou laboreſt; call wel to minde that he needeth no creature to lend him help. It happens fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be much better for you to mortify ſome diſordered appetite, then to preach many well ſtudied ſermons, or to doe divers rigorous penances. And if God deprive you of health, he gives you but therby occaſion to augment your merit.</p>
               <p>Serve not God according to your owne deſire, but as it is his bleſſed will. It would little availe à ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to take great paines, if it be not according to his Maiſters good likeing; for at the end of his labour,

If thou shalt be angry againſt me, what helper may I ſeeke? who will have mercy on my iniquities? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me, o Lord, who didſt call the woman of Canaan, and Publican to repentance; and didſt receive Peter weeping. O Lord my God accept my prayers. O good Jeſu, Saviour of the world, who gaveſt thy ſelfe to the death of the Croſſe, that thou mighteſt ſave ſinners; regard me a wretched offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, calling upon thy name; and take not ſuch heed to my wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that thou forget thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

               <p>O only ſonne of God, how great and ineffable are the bleſſings I have receiud' from thee! thou haſt produced me of the duſt and ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

Thou haſt conſerved me in the narrow priſon of my mothers wombe, to the end I might not dye without the ſaving water of holy baptiſme. After ſo many ſins as I have multiplid againſt thee, thou haſt had long pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience with me even to this houre, whilſt many others, leſſe guilty then my ſelfe, whom thou haſt not ſo long expected to repentance, are peradventure at preſent tormented in Hell. Beſides this, o my Lord, thou haſt vouchſafed to make thy ſelfe Man, and to converſe amongſt Men for my ſake. For me thou wouldeſt ſuffer grievous afflictions, a bitter agony, ſorrow of ſoule, and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50595:111"/>a bloody ſweate. Thou wouldſt be apprehended, bound, ſtruck, ſpit upon, injured, blaſpheamd', buffeted; thou wouldſt be clad at one tyme in a white robe, at an other in a red one, in mockery. For me thou wouldſt be beaten, ſcourgd, crownd with thorns, ſtruck with a reede, upon thy ſacred head, thou wouldſt be blindfoulded, condemned to death and dragged to the place of execution with a heavy croſſe upon thy back, to which croſſe thou wouldſt be faſtned with hard and-ruged nailes: thou wouldſt be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced betweene two theeves, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongſt the wicked. Call and vinagar was preſented to thee for thy laſt draught; and finally thou wouldſt looſe thy life by a moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell death In this manner, o my Lord, and with theſe ſufferings haſt thou redeemed me, and yet I moſt ungratefull for ſo great benefits, have many tymes crucified thee againe by my ſins, wherby I have merited

               <p>Moreover what shall I ſay of the fearefull abuſe I have made of thy Sacraments, thoſe bleſſed remedies which thou haſt ordaynd' me with thy moſt precious blood. Thou haſt washt, and receiud me in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Baptiſme as one belonging to thy ſelfe, there thou haſt adopted me thy ſonne: there thou haſt conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me as thy temple. Thou haſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed me as a Prieſt, as a King, and as a ſouldier, who ought inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly to fight againſt thy enemy. There thou haſt eſpouſed my ſoule to thy ſelfe, and adorn'd her with all the ornaments requiſite to ſo high a dignity. What have I done with all theſe jewels. What care have I taken to conſerve ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe riches? thou haſt adopted me thy ſonne, and I have rendred my ſelfe a ſlave to ſin. Thou haſt
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50595:112"/>conſecrated me thy temple, and I have made my ſelfe a Denne of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells. Thou haſt arm'd me as thy ſouldier, and I have taken part with thy enemy. Thou haſt anointed me a King, and I have employd the power thou haſt given me in rebell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt thee. Thou haſt eſpouſd my ſoule to thy ſelfe in perpetuall charity, and I have loved vanity more then truth, and preferd the creature before the Creator. It is now high tyme, O my Lord, that he who has committed all theſe exceſſes should begin to lament them. And this is what thou haſt ſo long expected of me, even ſince thou haſt given me my life. For this haſt thou ſo often cal'd me; ſo long tolerated me. For this haſt thou ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metymes chaſtiſed me other tymes comfotted me; thy infinit goodneſſe having uſed all poſſible meanes to drawe me to thee.

Thou haſt ſtruck me, and I have been inſenſible to thy ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. Thou haſt chaſtiſd me and I I have rejected thy diſcipline. Thou haſt labored and ſweate to purify me; yet neither thy mercifull ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, one the one ſide, nor thy juſt chaſtiſemonts on the other, have beene able to remoove the ruſt of my vices. I have hardned my hart aſwell againſt thy punishments, as againſt thy favours; having been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull to the one, and rebellious to the other. Nevertheleſſe, O my Lord, ſince thou haſt ſuffered ſo much for me, and haſt commanded me never to looſe confidence in thee, I recurre with my whole hart to thy mercy; beſeeching thee to give me grace for amendment: to the end that for the tyme to come, I may love and ſerve thee in ſuch

               <p>O Soueraine Creator of all things, I a moſt vile and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratfull ſinner proſtrate before thy ſacred feet in true griefe and harty ſorrow for all may haynous Treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes wher with I have ſo grievouſly offended my Lord and Maker; and for which thou haſt vouchſafed to endure ſo cruell torments upon the Croſſe. I confeſſe my great ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, deare Lord, for all thy innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable benefits, and for having thus mercifully ſpared me ſo long perſiſting in my ſinfull courſes, and contempt of thy divine commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and bleſſed will, for which in ſtead of caſting me into Hel, as I moſt juſtly deſerved, thy bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe goodneſſe hath expected me to penance, and amendment of my life. For which, o how often haſt thou knockd at the dore of my
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:50595:117"/>hart by thy heavenly inſpirations: how often haſt thou prevented me with bleſſings? allured me with comforts? drawne me with favours? Yea forced me many tymes by croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and afflictions to ſeeke unto thee? and yet neither hath my flinty hart been mollifid ther with, nor my will reclaymed. But behould now at laſt, o my ungratfull ſoule, the grievouſneſſ of this thy ſin; and pierce my obdurate hart o divine Redeemer, with contrition, and deteſtation of the foulneſſ of all my deteſtable offences; for which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy I am to be called thy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or whom the earth should beare, much leſſe afford ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully all conveniences for humane life to me, upon whom even nature it ſelfe ought rather to take juſt vengance of my great contempt, and odious ſin.</p>
               <p>O mercifull Father, how many by thy righteous judgment are now burning in the eternall flames of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50595:118"/>Hel for a leſſe number of ſins then thoſe of myne, who might have been Saints in Heaven, had they received ſo great a meaſure of thy gracious mercies, as I have donne. But now, o mercifull Father, of all pittie and compaſſion; in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feyned ſorrow and remonſe of conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience for all my miſdeeds; I proſtra to at thy feet moſt humbly beſeech thy pardon, looke on me, o loving Lord, a wretched ſinner, with the eye of mercy, as thou didſt on the pentitent Publican, the repentant Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen, and the Apoſtle who thrice denied thee, vouchſaſe once more to admit me againe unto thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious favour. Lord worke that ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily in me, for which cauſe thou haſt ſo long ſpared me, and to which, from all Eternity thou haſt orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me. But woe is me, who have refuſed to beſtow my hart on thee who wouldſt have made it a temple and habitation for thy owne aboad, which I have ſacrilegiouſly defiled
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50595:118"/>with ſo much impiety, and made it but as a ſtew of unpure thoughts. But I confeſſe all this my grievous wickedneſſe to thee my God of all piety, and therefore will not diſpaire; but throw my ſelfe into the ſea of thy infinit mercy; for as my ſins be numberleſſe, ſo are thy mercies endleſſe.</p>
               <p>O Moſt loving Father, if <hi>thou wilſt thou canſt make me cleane</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale the wounds of my ſoule. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſweet Lord, thy comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble promiſſe to us pronunced by thy Prophet: <hi>thou haſt committed folly with many lovers, yet returne thou againe to me, and I will receive thee.</hi> Great confidence this gives me, O Lord, and with my whole hart I returne to thee. I am that defiled ſoule; that prodigall child, that unfaithfull ſervant, who have ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated my ſelfe from thee. I have forſaken thee, o fountaine of living waters, and diged to my ſelfe ciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns which will hould no water; I
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50595:119"/>have fedd upon empty husks with the ſwyne, which could not ſatiate my hunger.</p>
               <p>But what is paſt, let it be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled, o gracious Lord, and forgot, I beſſech thee, and for the tyme to come, let there be an eternal cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant betwixt us; that thou wilt vouchſafe to be my mercifull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that I againe may be for everthy obedient and faithfull child. I aske, deare Lord, neither riches, honours, nor long life; but this one only thing alone, which I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſe to crave; that from this preſent inſtant untill the dreadfull houre of my death I may never more offend thy heavenly Majeſty, nor defile my conſcience with any mortall ſin.

               <p>IT may here finally be obſerved; as it happens ofentymes, that the ſick man dies becauſe he makes not uſe of the Phiſition, concealing his diſeaſe, and not following his order and daviſe: ſo many a ſoule doth perish for not making uſe of his
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50595:120"/>ſpirituall phiſition, by the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Confeſſion. The great benefit whereof (were it but well conſidered) we should not ſo much neglect the incomporable benefits which are to be reaped thereby. For being duly frequented, it expiats the guilt of all ſin, and changeth the eternall paine (which was due to mortall ſin) into temporall. It purifies our ſoules, and renders them gratefull to God, By infuſion of grace, and guifts of the holy Ghoſt. It greatly ſtrengthens as againſt all evill temptations, and gives great quiet to our couſcience. All which but ſcriouſly conſidered, who will neglect frequently to make vſe of ſo ſouveraine a good. For is there any that had he but a plant in his garden of ſo rare a vertue, as if but weekely taken, should cure all diſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſes, and preſerve him in perfect he alth; would he neglect to make uſe therof? undoubtedly he would not.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:50595:121"/>himſelfe both of all Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and grace. And therfore to be received with all purity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, to receive the great fruit and benediction therby. For as he who receives it worthely becomes the habitation and temple of God, who replenisheth him with all abundance of grace: ſo who receives him unworthely, receives (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Apoſtle) his owne dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and judgment.</p>
               <p>It doth therfore greatly import him, who approacheth to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine banquet. Firſt that he examen well himſelfe (as S. Paul doth exhort (that he come prepared, and fittingly diſpoſed, on his part. For which purpoſe theſe fowre diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are principally required.</p>
               <p>The firſt, a firme faith to beleeve Chriſts owne word, and his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches doctrine; teaching that the words of conſecration being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced; what was bread before, is changed by divine vertue into
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50595:121"/>the true, reall and ſubſtantiall body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and that although the colour, figure, taſte, and other accidents of breade re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, yet the ſubſtance is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the body of Jeſus Chriſt, which being now living, glorious, and immortall, it can receive no diviſion nor indignity, but is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his blood, ſoule, and divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>The ſecond diſpoſition required, is a great purity, principally from all mortall ſin; as alſo from all vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and deliberate affection, to either mortall or venial. And beſides this purity of conſcience, purity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of intention is requiſit: for he would be greatly blamable, who should approach to this divine ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vaine humaine reſpect, to be eſteemed devout, or to gaine the good opinion of Men. But his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be purely to pleaſe God, to be more cloſely united to him; and to be made more capable ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50595:122"/>to glorify, to love, and to ſerve his heavenly Majeſty.</p>
               <p>The third diſpoſition, is profound humility: to which the Chriſtian may ſtrongly be mooved, he well conſidering, on the one ſide Gods greatneſſe and infinit ſanctity, and his owne origen from nothing, brought by ſin to ſo deſpicable a ſtate, on the other. Which very thought ought to give great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a penitent ſinner now ready to approach to this God of all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Majeſty, before whom the Angels, Seraphins, and Cherubins doe tremble with reſpect and feare.</p>
               <p>Finally the fourth diſpoſition, is love and ardent charity towards this our divine Redeemer, who gives himſelfe to us with ſo exceſſive good neſſe, with graces and benedictions from the ſuperabundant fountaine of this divine Sacrament; flowing copiouſly into an open, and loving hart. And therfore undoubtedly the moſt excellent diſpoſition which a
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50595:122"/>Chriſtian can bring to the holy Communion, is to excite himſelfe interiorly to the fervent acts of love towards Jeſus Chriſt, with ſtrong reſolutions wholy to conſecrate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to pleaſe and love him, to ſerve and glorify him by his whole life and actions.</p>
               <p>But although theſe diſpoſitions regarding our ſoule, be both the principall and moſt neceſſary: yet ſuch as concerne the body muſt not be neglected. As firſt that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant preſent himſelfe to this divine banquet with fitting decency in apparell. With modeſt and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent comportment; yet all within the bounds of decent modeſty, and without all ſuperfluous affectation.</p>
               <p>He muſt alſo be faſting; and have ſwallowed nothing from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night before his communion. Who being now to approach to this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly table; it muſt be with great modeſty and devout humility: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Confiteor</hi> with true harty
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50595:123"/>ſorrow, for having offended ſo great and ſo good a God. And the Prieſt ſaying <hi>Domine non ſum dignus &amp;c.</hi> Let him humble his hart before God, acknowledging his great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe to receive ſo divine a guifte.</p>
               <p>The ſacred Hoſt being preſented unto him, he muſt receive it with all humble reſpect, his eyes ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding downwards, and opning mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately his mouth, without ſtirring his head or body, or moving his lipps with words. Let the tongue touch the ſide of the lipp, not too much put fourth; that it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently receive the holy Hoſt, which there moiſtned with decent motion may be let downe into the ſtomack: for it is not to be chewed with the teeth, nor to be brought to the rouſe of the mouth.</p>
               <p>Let the whole body be erected, and quiet without any motion, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, groning, knocking of the breaſt, exclamations, vocall prayers, or the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50595:123"/>like; which would be unfitting, and inconvenient.</p>
               <p>Having communicated, he muſt be carefull for one quarter of an houre, not to ſpit: but if forced to it; be carefull it be with reſpect, and where it be not trod upon; or more decently to take it with his handkercher.</p>
               <p>Let him retyre to ſome convenient place, where for the ſpace of a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an houre, at the leaſt, he ought to recollect his ſoule in than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes giving; conſidering whom he hath received, and with the eys of fervent faith, there to behould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his breaſt his loving Saviour, and God of all Majeſty: and with great attention, and devout acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of humble thankes for that ineſtimable benefit received: there offering, ſacrificing, and intirely conſecrating himſelfe, his ſoule, his body, and all the powers and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them both to his divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory for all Eternity.</p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:50595:124"/>
               <p> When you actually receiue the ſacred Hoſte conceive your ſelfe (as S. Thereſia did) as if behoulding with her corporal eyes, Jeſus Chriſt to enter into your poore habitation, and ſtirr up thor at your faith, laying aſide all mortall objects whatſoever. and as if entring in with him; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure there to recollect all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of your ſoule to attend upon that ſo divine a gueſt, to doe him all adoration and homage; ſo that they neyther diſtract nor hinder your ſoule from a quiet, and entire enjoyment of him. There repreſent your ſelfe as at his feet deploring with repentant Magdalen your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſins. And although we should have no other devotion, but this alone; yet faith would perſwade us that we were both well and very happy there to ſpeake with our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and loving Saviour ſo preſent to give care to the propoſitions of all our neceſſities; at leaſt whilſt the ſacramentall ſpecies remaine
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50595:124"/>uncorrupted with us. And therfore we muſt not looſe one moment of this ſo precious tyme of his true reall and ſubſtantiall preſence with us; but to ſpend it in all true fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent devotion, with ſo mercifull and powerfull a Lord and gueſt. For this is a moſt profitable practiſe after communion; which that ſeraphical 8. Thereſa did uſually excerciſe with great comfort and profit to her ſoule.</p>
               <p>And now finally that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſoule may the better comply with her duty in this divine action, as well before the holy communion, as alſo after the ſame; let her reade much rather with hart, then with mouth theſe following prayers: shee framing in her ſoule the interiour acts, which are but exteriorly fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in words.</p>

               <p>Neither are the ſimple and unle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arned people to think that this men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal prayer is too high a practiſe; for often tymes the ſimple people ſpeed beſt therein, as God himſelfe hath teſtifyd by the mouth of the ſacred Virgin Mother in her Magnificat

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:50595:190"/>wil and pleaſure in all; which is the certaine marke of a holy and fruitfull Medication, how dry or barren ſoever it ſeemed to them, and deprived of all ſenſible or ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction; or forced fervours; whilſt learneder perſons with all high ſpeculations producing no great affections nor reſolutions for the practiſe of vertue; all proves but vanity in their owne imagination, which produceth no fruit at all.</p>
               <p>But now that the leſſe learned people are not uncapable to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe this proſitable prayer of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; it may be fitly expreſſed by this familiar example of a pervere and wicked Meditation, made by a ſinner; of whome King David ſpeakes ſaying; <hi>and they who ſought me evils, ſpeakes vanities: and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate evils all the day.</hi> For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengfull man, pondering and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with him felfe of ſome diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, or injury, by memory he calls to mind the diſgrace, or wrong of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:50595:191"/>him. Then with his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he conſiders the nature and weight of ſuch an injury; and therby he provokes his will to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, to envie, to malice, and to ſecke revenge upon the party from whom he received it.</p>
               <p>This now is a moſt wicked Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, wholy interiour, and all without one word of the mouth.</p>
               <p>Even ſo in like manner (and quite to the contrary) a good Man, calling to minde his ſin, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries therby which he hath offered unto God; he ponders, conſiders, and examens the greatnes therof, the enormity, cauſes, effects, and the properties of ſin; whence he makes a firme reſolution, out of the hatred therunto, to banish the like hereafter, and to avoyde all future occaſions; and this is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour and a holy Meditation of ſin.</p>

               <p>If opportunity preſent it ſelfe, we ought, either upon the eve, or the day, which we deſigne for this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, to make our Sacramental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to the Prieſt: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:50595:201"/>which, for greater purity, and more veſt preparation, we may make our ſpirituall Conſeſſion to Jeins Chriſt before, or after the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall, each one according to his devotion.</p>
               <p>After Conſeſſion we are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate really, or ſpiritually in forme of viaticum; and to conſider it as the laſt Communion of out life.</p>
               <p>Vpon the day we perferme this exerciſe, if we have convenienty, we ought to heare Maſſe, to the end, that in his ſacrifice [which is a reall repreſentation of that of the Croſſe] we may more neerely and particulary unite our ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt dying, offring as well this as all other ſacrifices which shall be offred to the end of the world; for obtayning the grace of a good and holy death.</p>
               <p>It will be moſt profitable to fix one day in every month [each one according to his leaſure and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

But in that caſe, the acts of contrition, ſaith, hope, and charity, contayned in the firſt point, muſt be repeted. And beſides that, our Meditations and lectures of that day, ought to be upon the ſubject of death.</p>
               <p>We ought further to employ our ſelves more particularly in good workes and practiſes of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vertue.</p>
               <p>And it is to be noted, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be many acts preſcrib'd in this exercie, nevertheleſſe it is not intended therby to oblidge any one preciſely to thoſe acts, but only to facilitate the practiſe of them, to ſuch as have not yet attayned to a habit of ſuch acts; for the beſt are thoſe which love produces.</p>

               <p>IF God should leave the tyme, houre, and manner of our death to our choyſe, could we make a better then he himſelfe, who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daynes it by his infinite wiſedome, power, and goodneſſe, and who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made us for himſelfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us with his blood, deſires nothing ſo much as to ſave us, and conduct us to our laſt end? Since our faith teaches us this truth, why doe we not entirely abandon the care of our life and death to him? What can be more advantageous to us in Heaven, in Earth, in life and in death, then to accomplish his moſt juſt and holy will? And ſince we muſt neceſſarily undergoe the ordees of his divine will, were it not better to doe it meritoriouſly
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:50595:205"/>by an humble ſubmiſſion, and filial confidence in his divine goodneſſe, then to execute it by force, like the divels; and by our reſiſtance to render this action more worthy of puniſhment then reward?</p>
               <p>If the feare of our ſins cauſe us to apprchand death, and deſire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longation of life, to the end to doe penance for them, what penance can be more efficacious, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, then our perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to his holy will, and our entyre ſubmiſſion to the ſentence of our death, to the end to render him the obedience due from a creature to its Creator, and to teſtify to him that we preferre the honour of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, before our owne life? if the merit of our acts beare propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the difficulty we find in their execution, what can be more difficult then to renounce our life? and what better penance can we performe, then to give it with a good hart to God; ſince in makeing
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:50595:206"/>him this preſent, we not only give him all we are able to give, but alſo all which is moſt deare and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to us? <hi>no Man hath greater cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then he who layes downe his life,</hi> ſayes our divine Saviour, and if a God would vouchſafe for us to dye ſo painfull and grievous a death, and looſe his life upon a croſſe for our ſalvation, shall we dare to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him ours: shall we eſteeme our life more precious, or more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then his? O my ſoule if we lou'd God, ifwe had a true ſenſe, and acknowledgment of this ſoveraine benefit, would we not deſire to have a thouſand lives to give him!

            <p>WHeras God almightie doth (in ſome manner, and by certaine conduits, as it were) deſcende to us, ſo by prayer we aſcend (ſaith S. Franc. de Sales) unto him; <hi>prayer being properly</hi> [according to S. Jo. Damaſcen] <hi>an elevation of our minde unto God;</hi> and therefore what ever it be that truly doth raiſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly ſtirr upp our harts to bleſſe, to love, and to adore Almighty God, that properly is true, gratefull, and eſſentiall prayer, be it but procured by a pure intention for the glory of God in whatever we doe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by fervent ejaculations of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne love; by pious conſiderations, inducing us to the practiſe of vertu; or to a vertuous preparation for a bleſſed death, by holy maxims; or
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:50595:232"/>finally by vocall prayor, or mentall meditation, ſo that we bleſſe and praiſe God in all, that is the proper prayer which we are commanded to make continually, and <hi>without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion</hi> ſaith S. Paul, which could not be performed in that crytick ſenſe, but muſt neceſſarily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of all the pious exerciſes mentioned in this Manuel condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to raiſe our harts to the love and praiſe of God; and therfore [ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to S. Jo Damaſcen] <hi>they are true, proper, and eſsentiall prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe one may here juſtly demande, how this true and holy prayer may beſt be knowne, from that which is but falſe and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit; therfore I have judg'd it not unfitt to ſett downe the proper markes, and ſureſt ſignes wherby rightly to underſtand, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, the one from the other; which may ſerve as a true touchſtone for the right tryall of true holy and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table praye, from what is but falſe
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:50595:233"/>and deceiptfull; and it is principally intended for ſuch as doe practiſe the more elevated prayer of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; who, if not rightly guided, are more ſubject to illuſion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, then ſuch as only uſe vocall prayer, and the purgative way, which the over ſpeedy aſpirers unto the unitive, doe neglect before they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve lay'd the firſt foundation to it, in the purgative way, by labouring to deſtroy and ruyne ſin, to roote out vice, to correct evill habits, or vnruly paſſions, and diſordered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectations, the true and neceſſary preparation to that high prayer of holy contemplation, wherby with a pure intention we muſt ſincerely ſeeke the right end of true prayer without which it would be but vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and fruitleſſe. Now the true and pure end of all good prayer is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly therby to crave light from God to unſterſtand his holy will; and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to performe the ſame; with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creace in his love, and advancement in vertu.</p>

               <head>A touch-ſtone for right tryall of true and profitable prayer from what is but falſe and counterfait.</head>
               <p>THe bleſſed Apoſtle counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us not to give credit to every ſpirit, but to try if the ſpirit be of God. often tymes the divel transformes himſelfe into an Angel of light deceiving many: and moſt dangerouſly of all under the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of ſanctity: be propoſing to us his illuſions for divine favours. And therefore to prevent any danger to be deceived herein, obſerve well theſe markes wherby to avoyde or to diſcouer them.</p>
               <p>Firſt be aſſured <hi>ſaith Molina</hi> as of a generall Rule, that who will only give credit to himſelfe, in his ſpirituall affaires, and will be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by his owne judgment alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne; that man is utterly deceived and
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:50595:234"/>overthrowne, be he never ſo ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming wiſe, vertuous, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagned which all the ſignes of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſanctity; becauſe ſuch a ſpirit not ſubmitting his iudgment to any other man, nor communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with any for their adviſe; may well be preſumed naught and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
               <p>But ſome untimely contemplators will tell you, that they have good and approved Authors for their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. I anſwere that the Authors which they pretend for themſelves are pious and approved good; but the practiſe which they frame then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce according to their owne ſenſe and private opinion is allowed by none of the approved and beſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall directors of ſoules. whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, theſe over haſty contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ought farr to preferre before their owne. For ſectaries pretend many true texts of ſcripture for their falſe errours; but they refuſing the holy fathers and councells authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the true underſtanding ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:50595:234"/>and takeing them obſtinately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their owne deceived ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe and opinion, they runn wilfully into errour and hereſy, to their end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perdition.</p>
               <p>But they will reply to you, that the effect of true prayer is to unite our ſoule to God, wherby we are replenished with great conſolation and comfort, yea the very guſt and tender conſolation which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municats to the vertuous thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly ſerving him, doth give both ioy and courage to love and ſerve him by this fervent kind of holy prayer.</p>
               <p>For anſwere to this their reply, it is to be here obſerved, that there are two ſorts of ſenſible devo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion or conſolation, the one from God which is good; the other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and pernicious, proceeding from nature or from our ghoſtly enemy. Now the affections and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of our ſoule are knowne by their fruits: that hart is good, from which proceeds pious affections,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:50595:235"/>good effects, and holy actions. If it make us more humble, more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and more charitable, if more to mortify our unruly paſſions and affections; more conſtant in good exerciſes, more yealding and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to Superiours, more plaine dealing with Chriſtian ſyncerity in all our actions; then doubtleſſe theſe conſolations are from God.</p>
               <p>But if thoſe conſolations in devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſt only in our ſelves; or that we become more curious, peewish, captious, impatient, willfull, obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, fierce, preſomptuous, uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, leſſe ſubject to others di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; then undoubtedly ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall tenderneſſe or conſolation in prayer, is falſe and pernicious; <hi>for a good tree brings fourth good fruit.</hi> We muſt not therefore much regard theſe ſpirituall tender conſolations, but carefully obſerve what good fruit they produce in us. Thus that true director of all right and holy ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall S. Fran. de Sales.</p>
               <pb n="451" facs="tcp:50595:235"/>
               <p> And by this we now plainly ſee that the good fruits or effects of prayer can only give a right iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the goodneſſe and true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue thereof. If therefore by prayer, You find your ſelf more humble, deſirous to be contemned, leſſe willfull, more charitable &amp;c. No doubt but your prayer is Good, and profitable: if by it you grow more ſincere, leſſe curious, and willfull: if it produce more vigour of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to vertuous actions; if finally you find your ſelfe more meeke and patient; if mortification ſeeme plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to you for the love of God: if modeſty appeare in your geſture and converſation; if vertu be pleaſing to you, and vice diſtaſtfull: All theſe are ſecure ſignes of good and holy prayer; and infallible markes of true and ſolide devotion.</p>
               <p>An other ſecure marke that our prayer or meditation is true; is, when the ſoule regardeth not ſo much the conſolation, guſt, or ſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:50595:236"/>which shee feeles therin, as the effects which it cauſeth, of the forces which it brings and endeves her withall, to be therby more able to love, to pleaſe and to ſerve God, ſo that shee beareth very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently the want of theſe cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: yea even of her owne accord shee deprives herſelfe therof, for the leaſt occaſion offered to doe God the greater ſervice; or for her neighbours good, to give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to any due obligation therby: she kowing that true ſanctity or perfection conſiſts not in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch cherishments, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſome favours, but in the practice of true and ſolid vertues; wherin we ought ſo much the more to exerciſe our ſelves, by how much, ſuch cherishments and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are beſtowed upon vs in prayer which oblidgeth us to the greater perfection.</p>
               <p>But now contrariwiſe when this
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:50595:236"/>contemplation is falſe, and ſugges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the evill Spirit, then we are wholy bent and feed upon thoſe guſtfull contents; if therfore the privation therof makes us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient and diſcontent, and for feare of looſing this pleaſing ſenſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, we both relinquish our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and duty, to which otherwiſe we were bound: which they noe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes doe, who receive the true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits of God, but on the contrary; they much more deſire labour, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, mortification; and to beare their Croſſe for the love of God, with a pious hatred and contemp of their owne ſelves. Wheras that which is falſe and counterfait, encreaceth ſelf love, refuſeth, and shunneth any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Croſſes, and mortification, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A third ſecure ſigne and good marke to examen and know whether our prayer be of God, and his holy grace; or of nature only, (ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not ſolid, but dangerous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptfull) is, to obſerve our owne
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:50595:237"/>inclinations: if we couet that our good deedes, be made manifeſt, it is an effect of nature, wheras grace doth endevour to keepe them ſecret, therby to avoyde the honour and worldly glory which nature doth greatly couet: if againe we find, our ſelves variable and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, it is nature that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: for grace remaynes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and unvariable, as well in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie as in proſperitie, with humble reſignation and mortification of our ſelves, in all things according to the holy will of God, with much content and joy finally if ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſelf eſteeme, and deſire of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne glorie, be the ayme of our hart, know that nature rules; ſince grace doth abſolutly deſpiſe and hate them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly a true meanes to diſcover whether ons prayer begood, and of God; or whether badd, and from the evill Spirit, we muſt carrefully examen and obſerve, whether we ſeeke the mortification of our owne
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:50595:237"/>will, and inclinations of nature: or contrariwiſe, whether not much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our owne ſatisfaction and deſire, which nature ever ſeekes, alwayes excuſing her ſelve, and by no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes will be troubled, but by earneſt conteſting, projects and labour, yea even with violence, she ſtrives to preuaile and to obtayne her deſire in all. But Gods grace, and all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the good Angel, doth alwayes incite us to our owne ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and pretends no excuſe at all, Againe the inſtinct from the holy Ghoſt, and all motions from the grace of God, and from the good Spirit, doth both move and invite us unto ſubmiſſion and obedience, and ſtill directs and guides us from all vicious and ſinfull extreames.</p>
               <p>And to conclude moſt certaine it is, that, that prayer is not alwayes the beſt, which is moſt inflamed by greateſt feeling tenderneſſe, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and moſt vndoubtedly, that of which enſueth the beſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:50595:238"/>life, moſt profoundeſt humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, charity, patience, and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that it have the power to make this happy change. But if contrariwiſe our prayer have none of theſe good effects, but that it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves us in the ſame eſtate and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections wherin we were before, then undoubtedly, all our ſenſible devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and tender feelings of ſeeming great vertu, and perfection, are but falſe, and full of deluſion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt. And therfore hence it is that the chiefe and principall matter to be regarded, and well obſerved in prayer is, that after the end therof our reſolutions, good purpoſes, and pious feelings in the tyme therof, be afterwards put, by us, in faithfull practice and ezecution.</p>
               <p>Out of the premiſes is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the profit; the end, and true perfection of prayer, conſiſts in becomming therby more humble, more reſigned to God, more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and affable towards our
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:50595:238"/>neighbours, more obedient to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, more patient in contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp;c. for ſuch prayer beſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God, and is moſt profitable for our ſoules; it doth moſt edify our neighbour, and farre ſurpaſſeth the prayer although accompagned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with illuminations, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of fervourous affections not effectuall and efficacious in produ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cing that holy fruit of true vertue, which is the only profit, &amp; principall end of all true prayer, and meditation: prayer not being the end, but only the meanes to be vſed for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement in perfection, and to gaine therby the victory over our pereverſe inclinations and paſſions, and therfore we muſt not reſt only in our prayer, as in the end of our work, for perfection conſiſts not in much conſolation, or ſweetneſſe, or ſenſible guſt in our prayer, but in that perfect victory over our ſelfe, over our paſſions, and unruly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; as is ſaid; nor in the ſublim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt prayer, but in that which with a
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:50595:239"/>pure intention doth ſyncerely ſeeke the encreace in Gods divine love, our owne aduanement in vertu, with true reſignation to the wil of God, and a perfect contempt and abnega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſelves, renouncing all curioſity of Spirit, and ſelf ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by it; for otherwiſe we ſeeke not God ſo much as our ſelves, and our owne intereſt, and therfore no marvaile if we doe not finde him.</p>
